Summary:
\series default
 At present, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are increasily common
 to analyze non-model organisms that are important for agriculture as polyploid
 crops.
 A critical aspect in these studies is the importance to replicate the analysis,
 and one way to do this task is by using different tools to validate the
 accuracy of the associations.
 Currently, software for GWAS in polyploids is scarce, but recent advances
 in this area along with widely used diploid software can be used to replicate
 GWAS analyses.
 However, each software has its own characteristics (interface, inputs,
 outputs, and arguments) which can may cost time and effort to successqfully
 use them.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) is a type of analysis in genomics
 that allows identifying the set of variants across different individuals
 of a species that are associated with a phenotypic characteristic of research
 interest (REF).
 The GWAS studies are currently more frequently used in non-model organisms
 because the cost to obtain high-density sequencing through the genome is
 cheaper as the next-gen sequencing technology advance (REF).
 In plants, many of those non-model organisms include polyploid crops that
 are important for agriculture and the food security of different developing
 countries (REF).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Here, we present MultiGWAS, a tool to do GWAS analysis in tetraploid organisms
 by executing in parallel and integrating the results from four existing
 GWAS software: two for polyploids (GWASpoly and SHEsis) and the other two
 for diploids (Plink and Tassel).
 The tool deals with all the matters of the GWAS process in the four software,
 uses different control quality filters for the genomic data, and allows
 the execution of two GWAS models: Full and Naive, the first with control
 for population structure and individual relatedness, and the second without
 any control.
 The summary reports generated by MultiGWAS provide the user with tables
 and plots describing intuitively the markers found by each tool and by
 more than one tool, which help users to check for potential true or false
 associations.

Flowchart of the central steps in the MultiGWAS tool.
 The analysis is carried out by in three stages: adjustment, multi analysis,
 and integration.
 In the first stage, inputs are read from a configuration file (see below)
 and the genotype and phenotype are cleaned and filtered using the quality
 control (QC) filters.
 In the second stage, the new filtered genotype/phenotype are formated for
 each GWAS tool which are executed in parallel.
 In the last stage, the output files generated from each tool are scanned,
 and their results are summarized and reported through score tables, Venn
 diagrams, SNP profiles, and Manhattan plots.
 The configuration file includes: the genotype/phenotype filenames, genome-wide
 significance threshold, multiple testing correction method, GWAS model,
 number of associations to be reported, and TRUE or FALSE whether to use
 QC filters or not.
 The QC filters are: minor allele frequency, individual missing rate, SNP
 missing rate, Hardy-Weinberg threshold.

Motivation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The multiple available software packages provide the potential to enhance
 data analyses, but also create challenges for users.
 Most packages only use a command-line interface (CLI), which has a very
 steep learning curve for non-programmers.
 Furthermore, users must spend great effort when shifting from one package
 to another due to incon- sistent format requirements for input data.
 Users must take the time to reformat their data accordingly.
 As a result, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI)-based software
 package that can access multiple CLI packages, use any type of the input
 file format, and perform both GWAS and genomic prediction or selection
 is critically needed.
 (Chem2018)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Different GWAS programs often produce dissimilar association results.
 Newer proposed approaches usually claim to have increased statistical power
 over previous of GWAS programs, evaluations methods.
 However, there are few independent especially in a plant and plant genomics
 context.
 It is important to understand the behaviour of these popular GWAS programs,
 and their sensitivity to input data quantity and to phenotypes where varying
 numbers of biological replicates are observed.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
\size scriptsize
Background
\series default
: Non-coding RNAs gain more attention as their diverse roles in many cellular
 processes are discovered.
 At the same time, the need for efficient computational prediction of ncRNAs
 increases with the pace of sequencing technology.
 Existing tools are based on various approaches and techniques, but none
 of them provides a reliable ncRNA detector yet.
 Consequently, a natural approach is to combine existing tools.
 Due to a lack of standard input and output formats combination and comparison
 of existing tools is difficult.
 Also, for genomic scans they often need to be incorporated in detection
 workflows using custom scripts, which decreases transparency and reproducibilit
y.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
\size scriptsize
Results
\series default
: We developed a Java-based framework to integrate existing tools and methods
 for ncRNA detection.
 This framework enables users to construct transparent detection workflows
 and to combine and compare different methods efficiently.
 We demonstrate the effectiveness of combining detection methods in case
 studies with the small genomes of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes
 and Streptococcus pyogenes.
 With the combined method, we gained 10% to 20% precision for sensitivities
 from 30% to 80%.
 Further, we investigated Streptococcus pyogenes for novel ncRNAs.
 Using multiple methods–integrated by our framework–we determined four highly
 probable candidates.
 We verified all four candidates experimentally using RT-PCR.

Conclusions
\series default
: We have created an extensible framework for practical, transparent and
 reproducible combination and comparison of ncRNA detection methods.
 We have proven the effectiveness of this approach in tests and by guiding
 experiments to find new ncRNAs.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allows to analyze genomic data to
 identify the set of variants across different individuals of a species

 are currently more frequently used in non-model species as plants which

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main challenges in these GWAS analysis is to identify true from
 false associations, which can be validated by replicating the analysis
 using different tools.
 However, each tool has its own characteristics with different user interfaces
 (GUI or command line based), genotype/phenotype formats, models and algorithm
 assumptions, and different outputs, all of which take great effort to consider
 and makes it difficult for researches to do the replicatation.

\begin_layout Standard
With these considerations in mind, we developed the MultiGWAS tool that
 performs GWAS analyses by using four different GWAS software.
 The tool deals with all matters of the GWAS process in the four software:
 preprocessing genomic data using different quality control filters, transformin
g it to particular tool formats, executing each GWAS software in parallel,
 postprocessing outputs and creating reports.
 The reports provides the user with tables and plots showing the significative
 and best ranked markers, also the markers found by one tool and by more
 than one tool, all of this with the objecive to help users to decide in
 a more intuitively way the possible true or false associations.

Goal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the GWAS provide
 preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis
 by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the
 chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides
 a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data
 are unavailable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The objective of this study was to develop a software package with the following
 functions: (1) performs both GWAS and genomic predic-tion, including GWAS-assis
ted genomic prediction; (2) offers a friendly GUI to reduce user learning
 time and (3) requires only one input data format to conduct any analysis
 with any incorporated method.

Intro:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Recent advances in genomics technologies have led to an explosion in available
 data.
 It is now possible to phenotype and genotype populations of hundreds, or
 even thousands, of plants.
 This data can then be used to run genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
 GWAS can associate differences in allele frequencies with differences in
 measured phenotypes.
 This has led to advances in understanding the genetic basis of many plant
 traits, from flowering time in soybean (Zhang et al., 2015) to fruit phenotypes
 in peach (Cao et al., 2016) and disease resistance in canola (Raman et al.,
 2016).
 (Roby2019)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- Current advances in genomics and bioinformatics provide opportunities
 for accelerating crop improvement.
 The rise of third generation sequencing technologies is helping overcome
 challenges in plant genome assembly caused by polyploidy and frequent repetitiv
e elements (Armin2018).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- As a result, high-quality crop reference genomes are increasingly available,
 benefitting downstream analyses such as variant calling and association
 mapping that identify breeding targets in the genome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- Currently, algorithms and softwares for genetic analysis of diploid organisms
 with bi-allelic markers are well-established, while those for polyploids
 are limited.
 (Shen2016)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- Despite the importance of polyploidy and the increasing availability of
 new genomic data, there remain important gaps in our knowledge of polyploid
 population genetics.
 (Dufresne2014)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- So far, there have been two software tools released for polyploid GWAS,
 namely the R package GWASpoly (Rosyara et al., 2016) and the previously
 mentioned SHEsisPlus (Shen et al., 2016).
 Of these, only GWASpoly looks critically at the form of the kinship matrix
 K.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The GWAS Pipeline was built in Python 2.6 and facilitates running GWAS.
 Given PLINK-formatted genotype and phenotype files, the pipeline will match
 them, apply filters, make kinship matrix and covariate files.
 Then the pipeline will run GWAS using linear mixed model(by EMMAX), and
 build Manhattan and QQ plots for each trait.
 In addition, the pipeline will also output a summary file showing only
 the most significant SNPs with allele effect calculated.

 to perform their particular GWAS analysis (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It starts by preprocessing the genomic data by selecting individuals present
 in both genotype and phenotype, and excluding individuals and SNPs that
 are likely to be of poor-quality.

 for Plink and Tassel (e.g.

 MultiGWAS does this by coding each marker in one of two possible ways:
 all possible homozygous genotypes are coded with two nucleotides (AAAA→AA,
 CCCC→CC, GGGG→GG, TTTT→TT); and all possible heterozygous genotypes are
 coded with the combination of their reference and alternate alleles calculated
 from the tetraploid marker (e.g.
 AAAT→AT, ...
 ,CCCG→CG).
 After that, the new filtered genotype and phenotype are transformed to
 the specific formats required for each tool using different own functions
 from MultiGWAS.

 The first with control for population structure and individual relatedness;
 and the second without any of these controls.
 Controlling of population structure is based on the principal components
 (PCs) where each tool calculates the PCs and uses the top ten as covariates
 in their GWAS analysis.
 Controlling of individual relatedness is based on kinship matrices, where
 Tassel and GWASpoly make their own calculations, but Plink and SHEsis calculate
 them externally by the king software

 In the first case (figure

 (text in red, figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.A).
 It can be explained as the statistical GWAS model used was Naive, without
 any controls for population structure or individual relatedness.
 However, two markers from this set, c1_8019 and c2_25471, were also reported
 by Rosayra et al., the first as the most significative association, and
 second as the second best ranked association.
 So, the four tools agreed

In the second case (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.B), it shows that the set of common markers found by the tools was reduced,
 which can be explained as the statistical GWAS model used was Full, with
 controls for population structure (10 PCs) and individual relatedness (kinship
 matrix).
 Now, the two polyploid tools GWASpoly and SHEsis found the common marker
 c1_8019, as in the Naive GWAS, which help us to consider whit more confidence
 that this marker is a true association.
 But, the two diploid tools found a different common marker, the c1_16001,
 which was nof found in the first case (figure
