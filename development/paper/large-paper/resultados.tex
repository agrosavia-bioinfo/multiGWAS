\section{Results}

Although most of the GWAS packages used by MultiGWAS are based on a linear regression approaches, they often produce dissimilar association results for the same input. For example, computed \emph{$pvalues$ }for the same set of SNPs are different between packages; SNPs with significant \emph{p-values} for one packages are not significant for the others; or well-ranked SNPs in one package may be ranked differently in another. To alleviate these difficulties, MultiGWAS produces four reports using different graphics and tabular views, including: score tables, Venn diagrams, Manhattan and Q-Q plots, and SNP profiles. These views are intended to help users to compare, select, and interpret the set of possible SNPs associated with a trait of interest. 

Here, we show the reports resulting from running MultiGWAS tool in the genomic data from a tetraploid potato diversity panel, genotyped and phenotyped as part of the USDA-NIFA Solanaceae Coordinated Agricultural Project (SolCAP) \cite{Hirsch2013}. The reports include: significant SNPs, best-ranked SNPs, profile SNPs, and visualization of associations.

First, the significant SNPs (Figure \ref{fig:view-significatives}), where the two polyploid software, GWASpoly and SHEsis, found as significant three SNPs, c1\_8019, c2\_25471, and c2\_45606, of which the c1\_8019 was also the most significant association found in the same potato dataset analyzed by Rosyara et al. (2016). Second, the best-ranked SNPs (Figure \ref{fig:view-best-ranked}), where the SNP c2\_45606 was evaluated with a high score by the four packages, but other SNPs were also ranked with high scores by almost two packages. Third, the SNP profiles(Figure XX), where for each significant association, a heat map figure is generated to summarize the genotype associated with a trait for each individual. And fourth, the visualization of associations (Figure YY), where for each package, a Manhattan and QQ plots are generated using special marks to help to identify significative, best-ranked, and shared SNPs (found by more than one tool). 

The complete report from MultiGWAS for the naive and full model is in the Supplementary information (\url{https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e8b8de6ae23ed0001a9a14f})

\subsection{Visualization of significant SNPs }

GWAS packages compute \emph{$pvalues$} as a measure of association between each individual SNP and the trait of interest. The SNPs are considered statistically significant, and consequently possible true associations, when their $pvalue$ fall below a predefined significance level, usually 0.01 or 0.05. 

Here, the MultiGWAS reports the SNPs considered statistically significant by each GWAS package. For that purpose, it provides two views: a tabular and Venn diagram. The table shows detailed information of the SNPs, where both $pvalues$ and significance levels have been scaled as $-log_{10}(pvalue)$, score (SCR) and threshold (THR) in the Figure \ref{fig:view-significatives}.A. Whereas, Venn diagram visually shows the same SNPs but emphasizing if these were significant either for a single package or for more than one. As an example, Figure \ref{fig:view-significatives} shows the significative SNPs resulting from running MultiGWAS on a tetraploid potato dataset.

\subsection{Visualization of best-ranked SNPs }

Most GWAS packages compute differently both \emph{pvalues }and significance levels, and these values may be computed either to high or to low, respectively. This results in SNPs with low \emph{pvalues }but that did not reach the significance levels defined by the packages.  Consequently, as it is important to know the significant SNPs, it is equally important to know these SNPs closer to being statistically significant, as they may represent important associations to consider for posterior analysis (e.g. false negatives).

As in the previous section, MultiGWAS tool provides a table and a Venn diagram to report these best-ranked SNPs for each GWAS package, wheter these SNPs were assesed significant or not. The number of SNPs to be reported is defined by the user in the configuration file, and these SNPs are listed in the table by tool in order of decreasing score, whereas the Venn diagram visually shows the same SNPs but emphasizing if these were best-ranked either in a single package or in several at once. Figure \ref{fig:view-best-ranked} shows the MultiGWAS best-ranked SNPs resulting from GWAS analysis on the tetraploid potato dataset.

\subsection{Visualization of Associations }

MultiGWAS uses classical Manhattan and Quantile\textendash Quantile plots (QQ plots) to visualize the results of GWAS analysis from each package. In both plots, SNPs are represented by dots and their $pvalues$ are transfomed to scores as $-log_{10}(pvalue)$ (see Figure \ref{fig:view-qqmanhattan}). The Manhattan plot displays the SNP association strength (y-axis) distributed in their genomic location (x-axis), so the higher the score the stronger the association. Whereas the QQ plot is used to visually compare the expected distribution of $pvalues$ (y-axis) vs. the observed distribution (x-axis), so under the null hypothesis of no association of SNPs with the phenotype, both distributions should coincide, and most SNPs should lie on a diagonal line.

\caption{\textbf{\scriptsize{}MultiGWAS visualization of associations.}{\scriptsize{} MultiGWAS adds special marks to the Manhattan and QQ plots to help identify different types of SNPs: (a) In Manhattan plots, significant SNPs are above a red line, best-ranked SNPs are above a blue line, and shared SNPs (See Figure \ref{fig:view-best-ranked}) are colored in green (b) In QQ plots, a red diagonal line indicates the expectation, so potential associations can be observed when the number of SNPs deviating from the diagonal is small, as in the case of monogenic traits, or when this number is somewhat higher, as in the case of truly polygenic traits. However, deviations for a high number of SNPs could reflect inflated $pvalues$ owing to population structure or cryptic relatedness. \label{fig:view-qqmanhattan}}}
