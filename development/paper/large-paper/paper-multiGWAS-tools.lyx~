Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have selected four GWAS software tools to be integrated in our multiGWAS
 tool, two designed specifically for polyploid species as many important
 crops are polyploids: GWASpoly

 and SHEsis

 humans and plants: PLINK

 and TASSEL

, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As MultiGWAS implements two types of GWAS analysis, naive and full, each
 tool is called in two different ways.
 The naive without any additional parameter, but the full with two parameters
 that take into account for population structure (Q) and relatedness (K)
 to prevent false associations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
GWASpoly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GWASpoly is a recent R package designed for GWAS in polyploid species that
 has been used in several studies in plants 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Berdugo2017,Ferrao2018,Sharma2018,Yuan2019"

\end_inset

.
 It is based on the Q+K linear mixed model with biallelic SNPs that accounts
 for population structure and relatedness.
 In addition, to calculate the SNP effect for each genotypic class, GWASpoly
 provides a general gene action model along with four additional models:
 additive, simplex dominant, and duplex dominant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using GWASpoly version 1.3.
 The population structure and relatedness, used in the full model, are estimated
 using the first five principal components and the kinship matrix, respectively,
 both calculated with the algorithms built in GWASpoly.
 For both, naive and full models, all gene action models are tested for
 detecting associations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
SHEsis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SHEsis is another program designed for polyploid species that includes single
 locus association analysis, among others.
 It is based on a linear regresion model, and it has been used in some studies
 of animals and humans

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using the version 1.0 which does not take account for population
 structure or relatedness, however MultiGWAS externally estimates relatedness
 for SHEsis by excluding individuals with cryptic first-degree relatedness
 using the algorithm implemented in PLINK 2.0 (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
PLINK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PLINK is one of the most extensively used programs for GWAS in diploids
 species.
 It was developed for humans but it is applicable to any species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 PLINK includes a range of analysis, including univariate GWAS using two-sample
 tests and linear regression models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using two versions of PLINK: 1.9 and 2.0.
 Linear regression from PLINK 1.9 is used to achieve both types of analysis,
 naive and full.
 For the full analysis, population structure is estimated using the first
 five principal components calculated with the PLINK 1.9 built in algorithm.
 But relatedness is estimated from the kinship coefficients calculated with
 the PLINK 2.0 built in algorithm, removing the close relatives or individuals
 with first-degree relatedness.

TASSEL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TASSEL is another common GWAS program based on the Java software.
 It was developed for maize and it has been used in several studies in plants
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, but like PLINK, it is applicable to any species.
 For association analysis, TASSEL includes the general lineal model (GLM)
 and mixed linear model (MLM) that accounts for population structure and
 relatedness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using TASSEL 5.0, with naive GWAS achieved by the GLM, and full
 GWAS achieved by the MLM with two parameters: one for population structure,
 using the first five principal components, and another for relatedness,
 using the kinship matrix with centered IBS method, both calculated with
 built in the TASSEL built in algorithms.

Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
GWAS were implemented by GAPIT packages (Lipka et al., 2012) in R software,
 using the mixed linear model (PCA + K) (Yu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2010),
 which took the population structure and relative kinship into account.
 The variance–covariance kinship matrix (K) was automatically calculated
 using the VanRaden method (Vanraden, 2008).
 The first four principal components of the SNP data were included in the
 GWAS model.
 The threshold for P value was calculated based on the number of the markers
 (P = 1/n, n = total SNP used) according to the method of Li et al.
 (2013).
 To combine the GWAS results in all of the 14 environments, a uniform suggestive
 genome‐wide significance threshold (P value = 1.0e−3) was given.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Popular GWAS software tools (Bradbury et al., 2007; Lipka et al., 2012) are
 confined to a single population and using linear mixed models (LMMs), in
 particular the QK model, which incorporates both a population stratification
 structure (Q) matrix and a kinship (K) matrix (Yu et al., 2006).
 Recently, several modified models, such as the compressed mixed linear
 model (Zhang et al., 2010), multi-locus mixed model (Segura et al., 2012),
 FarmCPU (Liu et al., 2016) and the integration of Kruskal–Wallis test with
 empirical Bayes (pkWemEB) (Ren et al., 2018), were proposed to achieve fast
 computation and high statistical power.
