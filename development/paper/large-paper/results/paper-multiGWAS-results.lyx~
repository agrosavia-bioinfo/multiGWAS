Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Y.
 Yan et al.
 (2019) evaluated four GWAS software packages for diploid species, PLINK,
 TASSEL, GAPIT, and FaST-LMM, in the context of plant genomes and phenotypes,
 specifically they used two datasets of diploid 
\emph on
Arabidopsis thaliana
\emph default
.
 Although, most of the evaluated packages are based on linear regression
 approaches, the four packages produced association results with different
 number of SNPs passing a predefined 
\emph on
p-value 
\emph default
threshold for a given GWAS package.
 It means that well-ranked SNPs from one package can be ranked differently
 in another, causing difficulty to select the most plausible associations
 when results from each tool are analyzed separately.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chen and Zhang (2018) developed a software package called iPAT that incorporates
 three GWAS software packages for diploid organisms, GAPIT, PLINK, and FarmCPU.
 The main objective of iPat was to facilitate, using a graphical user interface
 (GUI), the interaction with these command-line packages, including input
 data, execution, and presentation of output results.
 Although iPat helps users to work with these packages with a user-friendly
 interface, results from the execution of each package are shown separately
 and the problem of selecting the best associations from multiple package
 results persists.

When dealing with quantitative phenotypes, linear regression approaches
 are usually applied, often based on Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) and
 Mixed Linear Models (MLMs).
 MLMs are also known as Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) in the literature.
 In this work, we will also refer to them as LMMs

\begin_layout Standard
We have selected four GWAS software tools to be integrated in our multiGWAS
 tool, two designed specifically for polyploid species as many important
 crops are polyploids: GWASpoly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and SHEsis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, and another two designed for diploids species and extensively used in
 humans and plants: PLINK 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Purcell2007,Chang2015"

\end_inset

 and TASSEL 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As MultiGWAS implements two types of GWAS analysis, naive and full, each
 tool is called in two different ways.
 The naive without any additional parameter, but the full with two parameters
 that take into account for population structure (Q) and relatedness (K)
 to prevent false associations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
GWASpoly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GWASpoly is a recent R package designed for GWAS in polyploid species that
 has been used in several studies in plants 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Berdugo2017,Ferrao2018,Sharma2018,Yuan2019"

\end_inset

.
 It is based on the Q+K linear mixed model with biallelic SNPs that accounts
 for population structure and relatedness.
 In addition, to calculate the SNP effect for each genotypic class, GWASpoly
 provides a general gene action model along with four additional models:
 additive, simplex dominant, and duplex dominant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using GWASpoly version 1.3.
 The population structure and relatedness, used in the full model, are estimated
 using the first five principal components and the kinship matrix, respectively,
 both calculated with the algorithms built in GWASpoly.
 For both, naive and full models, all gene action models are tested for
 detecting associations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
SHEsis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SHEsis is another program designed for polyploid species that includes single
 locus association analysis, among others.
 It is based on a linear regresion model, and it has been used in some studies
 of animals and humans 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Qiao2015,Meng2019"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using the version 1.0 which does not take account for population
 structure or relatedness, however MultiGWAS externally estimates relatedness
 for SHEsis by excluding individuals with cryptic first-degree relatedness
 using the algorithm implemented in PLINK 2.0 (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
PLINK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PLINK is one of the most extensively used programs for GWAS in diploids
 species.
 It was developed for humans but it is applicable to any species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Power2016"

\end_inset

.
 PLINK includes a range of analysis, including univariate GWAS using two-sample
 tests and linear regression models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using two versions of PLINK: 1.9 and 2.0.
 Linear regression from PLINK 1.9 is used to achieve both types of analysis,
 naive and full.
 For the full analysis, population structure is estimated using the first
 five principal components calculated with the PLINK 1.9 built in algorithm.
 But relatedness is estimated from the kinship coefficients calculated with
 the PLINK 2.0 built in algorithm, removing the close relatives or individuals
 with first-degree relatedness.

TASSEL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TASSEL is another common GWAS program based on the Java software.
 It was developed for maize and it has been used in several studies in plants
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Alvarez2017,Zhang2018"

\end_inset

, but like PLINK, it is applicable to any species.
 For association analysis, TASSEL includes the general lineal model (GLM)
 and mixed linear model (MLM) that accounts for population structure and
 relatedness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS is using TASSEL 5.0, with naive GWAS achieved by the GLM, and full
 GWAS achieved by the MLM with two parameters: one for population structure,
 using the first five principal components, and another for relatedness,
 using the kinship matrix with centered IBS method, both calculated with
 built in the TASSEL built in algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although most of the GWAS tools used by MultiGWAS are based on a linear
 regression approaches, they often produce dissimilar association results
 for the same input.
 For example, computed 
\emph on
p-values 
\emph default
for the same set of SNPs are different between tools; SNPs with significant
 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 for one tool are not significant for the others; or well-ranked SNPs in
 one tool may be ranked differently in another.
 To alleviate these difficulties, MultiGWAS produces different visual and
 tabular outputs intended to help users to compare, select, and interpret
 the set of possible SNPs associated with a trait of interest.
 These outputs include score tables, Venn diagrams, and SNP profiles, organized
 into two categories of SNPs: the best-ranked and significative SNPs.
 Next, we describe these outputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Best-ranked SNPs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In GWAS analysys, 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 are used to estimate
\emph on
 
\emph default
the significance of SNPs with a trait of interest.
 Often, the 
\emph on
p-values
\emph default
 computed for the SNPs by GWAS packages are different from each other, and
 well-ranked SNPs in one or more tools are not so well-ranked in another.
 As a consequence, these well-ranked SNPs may be significant for one or
 more tools but not for the others.

When dealing with quantitative phenotypes, linear regression approaches
 are usually applied, often based on Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) and
 Mixed Linear Models (MLMs).
 MLMs are also known as Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) in the literature.
 In this work, we will also refer to them as LMMs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Different GWAS programs often produce dissimilar association results.
 Newer proposed approaches usually claim to have increased statistical power
 over previous methods.
 However, there are few independent evaluations of GWAS programs, especially
 in a plant and plant genomics context.
 It is important to understand the behaviour of these popular GWAS programs,
 and their sensitivity to input data quantity and to phenotypes where varying
 numbers of biological replicates are observed
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MultiGWAS tool provides both a tabular and graphical view of the 
\emph on
N 
\emph default
best-ranked SNPs for each GWAS tool.
 These SNPs may or may not have been evaluated as significant by the tools,
 and 
\emph on
N 
\emph default
is an integer predefined by the user in the configuration file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1 shows an example of a table and the Venn diagram of the best-ranked
 SNPs resulting for a GWAS analysis performed by the MultiGWAS tool.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following table shows the associations between SNPs and the trait as
 transformed p-values to scores as -log 10 (p-value) sorted from the highest
 to the lowest scores based on each tool analysis and the model selected
 (Full or Naive).
 Each SNP has its associated information, such as the chromosome, position
 in the genome, and name.
 Also, based on the threshold calculated by a multiple testing correction
 (i.e., Bonferroni or FDR), the table marks the significance of each SNP as
 a TRUE or FALSE.

Table and Venn diagram of Best-ranked SNPs.
 The table shows the associations between SNPs and the trait as transformed

 sorted from the highest to the lowest scores based on each tool analysis
 and the model selected (Full or Naive).
 Each SNP has its associated information, such as the chromosome, position
 in the genome, and name.
 Also, based on the threshold calculated by a multiple testing correction
 (i.e., Bonferroni or FDR), the table marks the significance of each SNP as
 a TRUE or FALSE.

-ready graphs and tables, and to help users interpret the results through
 this variety of outputs.
 Importantly, these outputs aid in visualizing and understanding the results
 of each step in the GWAS and genomic prediction process, from diagnoses
 of phe- notypes and genotypes to assessment of statistical power and genomic
 prediction accuracy.
 Next, we provide descriptions and illustrative examples of the GAPIT’s
 enhanced capabilities.
