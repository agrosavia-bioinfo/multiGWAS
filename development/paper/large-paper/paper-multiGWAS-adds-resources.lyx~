Three different methods are available in GWASpoly for establishing a p-value
 detection threshold for statisti- cal significance.
 The first is the Bonferroni correction, which uses a threshold of a/m to
 ensure the genome- wide type I error with m markers is no greater than
 a.
 The second approach is the random permutation test, in which phenotypes
 are randomly permuted to explicitly construct the genome-wide null distribution
 of p-values (Churchill and Doerge, 1994).
 The third option uses the qvalue package (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003)
 to control the genome-wide false discovery rate (rather than Type I error
 = probability of false positive).
 For the simulations, due to their computationally intensive nature, we
 used the Bonferroni correction with a = 0.05.
 For the analysis of the real potato data, we used the permutation test
 with 1000 permutations and genome-wide a = 0.05.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In a traditional (univariate) genome-wide association study, a measure of
 association or statistical dependence between each individual SNP and the
 phenotype is computed.
 Then a p-value is derived for each association score, which represents
 the probability of observing an association signal of the same strength
 or stronger under the null hypothesis of no association between the SNP
 and the phenotype.
 If the p-value falls below a predefined significance threshold α, commonly
 0.01 or 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected, which means that there is
 an association between the SNP and the phenotype.
 Despite the strong evidence against the null hypothesis in this case, there
 remains a chance of α∗ 100% that the low p-value is purely due to random
 chance and that the detected association is therefore a false positive
 result.
 Avoiding false positive findings is among the major challenges in GWAS.

The first is the Manhattan plot, which plots the P value of each variant
 against its position (see the figure).
 The x-axis represents the genomic location.
 The y-axis is the –log(P value).
 The logarithmic scale is used so that the most significant single-nucleotide
 polymorphisms (SNPs) stand out with higher values than the majority of
 non-significant SNPs.
 A reference line is used on the y-axis to reflect genome-wide significance,
 occasionally with a second line to represent a ‘suggestive significance’
 threshold.
 Owing to the expectation of linkage disequilibrium (LD), a single highly
 significant SNP on its own is often interpreted as a genotyping error.
 Columns of significant SNPs in LD with the truly causal variant are seen
 in human studies, although this expectation is dependent on the LD of the
 organism.

In a Manhattan plot [42], each dot corresponds to one genetic marker (SNP).
 Its genetic location is indicated on the x-axis, and the –log10 of its
 p-value on the y-axis (see plots in second column of Fig.
 3a–d).
 This transformation results in SNPs with low p- values (and therefore stronger
 association) to have high values on the y-axis.
 Due to LD, SNPs in close proximity to each other show similar association
 to the phenotype, resulting in spikes in close proximity to SNPs with low
 p-values.
 This resembles the Manhattan skyline and gave rise to the term Manhattan
 plot.

Associations between phenotypes and genetic markers are outputted to tab-delimit
ed text files (Supplemental Table S1) and displayed as Manhattan plots.
 Genetic markers are positioned by their chromosomes and ordered by their
 base-pair positions.
 Genetic markers on adjacent chromo- somes are displayed with different
 colors.
 The strength of the association signal is displayed in two ways.
 One indicator of strength is the height on the vertical axis for –log P-values;
 
\series bold
the greater the height, the stronger the associa- tio

n (Fig.

 The other indicator is the degree of filling in the dots; the greater the
 area filled within the dot, the stronger the association.
 Users can place vertical lines at specific positions along the x-axis to
 identify candidate genes

The Q-Q plot is used to assess the number and magnitude of observed associations
 between genotyped single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the disease
 or trait under study
\series default
, compared to the association statistics expected under the null hypothesis
 of no association.
 Observed association statistics (eg, ?2 or t statistics) or −log10 P values
 calculated from them, are ranked in order from smallest to largest on the
 y-axis and plotted against the distribution that would be expected under
 the null hypothesis of no association on the x-axis.
 Deviations from the identity line suggest either that the assumed distribution
 is incorrect or that the sample contains values arising in some other manner,
 as by a true association.

The second is the quantile-quantile (QQ) plot, which compares the distribution
 of –log(P value)s observed in the study (y-axis) with the expected distribution
 under the null hypothesis (x-axis; see the figure).
 
\series bold
\color blue
Departure of observed SNP P values from the y = x reference line may reflect
 systematic inflation in the test statistics owing to population stratification.
 However, a departure from this line is also expected for a truly polygenic
 trait, as many causal SNPs may not yet have reached genome-wide significance
 owing to a lack of power.

\series default
 
\color inherit
This will lead to an excess of low P values across all SNPs.
 As a result, it is the point at which the observed –log(P value)s depart
 the y = x distribution that is important.
 Inflated –log(P value)s for all SNPs reflects population stratification,
 w
\series bold
hereas polygenicity should lead to inflation for only those SNPs with high
 –log(P value)s.

 The QQ plot is, therefore, a qualitative judgement rather than a quantitative
 one.

However, a calculation of the lambda value (λ; also known as the genomic
 inflation factor), which is derived by dividing the median value of the
 observed chi-squared statistic by the median expected chi-squared statistic
 (for P = 0.5), 
\series default
\color inherit
gives a measure of the inflation in the sample.
 This should be 1 in the case of the null and is generally seen as inflation
 if above 1.05.
 The lambda value can be weighted by sample size to avoid polygenic inflation,
 as larger samples have the power to detect inflation owing to many SNPs
 of small effect.
 In this case, λ1000 is used to get an inflation estimate proportional to
 a GWAS that contained only 1,000 samples.

ion.

Under the general assumption in GWAS that only a small portion of the SNPs

 Deviations for a high number of markers, especially in the range of intermediat

A key diagnostic for GWAS is a quantile-quantile plot of the observed vs.
 expected –log p values, which should follow a uniform distribution under
 the null hypothesis.
 The inflation of p-values above the y = x line in such a plot is an indicator
 of the failure of the model to control for population structure.
 Inflation was quantified by the linear regression coefficient of the observed
 vs.
 expected – log10 p-values, denoted l, which has a value of 1 under the
 null hypothesis (Riedelsheimer et al., 2012)

Another approach is to visually observe how the most significant P values
 deviate from the expected distribution.

\series default
 Ideally, a higher than expected fraction of marker-associated P values
 will be skewed toward significant values.
 To assist in this form of analysis, quantile-quantile plots of the association
 values per trait are available.
 Such plots are a scatterplot of the expected and observed distributions
 that allow deviations to be clearly identified.
 Points that are noticeably different from the diagonal or deviate from
 the trend are potential candidates for further examination.

 the null hypothesis (i.e., the markers that are not associated with the phenotype
).
 A red line indicates the expectation.
 The area of the 95% confidence interval is filled in gray.
 The dots above the confidence interval on the right indicate the genetic
 markers that are associated with the phenotype.

Similar to the importance of avoiding false positive findings in GWAS, it
 is equally crucial to avoid missing true associations, the so-called false
 negatives.
 False negatives occur when the statistical signal of the marker is not
 strong enough to reach genome- wide significance.
 Possible reasons for this are (a) little evidence in the data to support
 the statistical association, e.g., because of a small sample size, or (b)
 the significance threshold being too low.

 are usually applied, often based on Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) and
 Mixed Linear Models (MLMs).
 MLMs are also known as Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) in the literature.

 This inflation can be caused, for example, by population structure or cryptic

 As mentioned in Subheadings 1.3.1 and 3.4—for population structure—a correction
 needs to be performed in order to avoid reporting false positive results

As the very nature of GWAS involves hundreds of thousands of accession-phenotype
 association tests, multiple testing correction needs to be addressed.
 To this end, the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)
 is employed to correct the pro- vided P values.
 Another approach is to visually ob- serve how the most significant P values
 deviate from the expected distribution.
 Ideally, a higher than ex- pected fraction of marker-associated P values
 will be skewed toward significant values.
