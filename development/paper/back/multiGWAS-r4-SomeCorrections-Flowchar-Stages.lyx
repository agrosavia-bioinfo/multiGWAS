Motivation:
\series default
 Although the GWAS software for polyploids organisms is scarce, other diploid
 software has also been use to analyze these organisms.
 This set of available GWAS software provides the possibility to replicate
 a study by using multiple tools, which helps to the researches to check
 for true associations when these ones are found by more than one tool.
 However, each tool has its own characteristics (interface, inputs, outputs,
 and arguments) which can may cost time and effort to successfully use them.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series bold
Results:
\series default
 We have developed an R tool, MultiGWAS, to do GWAS analysis in polyploids
 organisms by executing and integrating the analysis results from four existing
 GWAS software: two for polyploids (GWASpoly and SHEsis) and the other two
 for diploids (Plink and Tassel).
 MultiGWAS allows users to run two kinds of GWAS: Full and Naive.
 The first considering the population structure and cryptic relatedness,
 and the second without these considerations.
 MultiGWAS receives a simple configuration file and the tool deals with
 all matters of the GWAS process to finally summarize and report results
 in a table and intuitive graphics formats to help researches to check potential
 true or false associations.

Flowchart of the central steps in the MultiGWAS tool.
 The GWAS analysis is carried out by MultiGWAS in three stages: adjustment,
 multi analysis, and Integration.
 In the first stage, inputs are read from a configuration file (see below)
 and the genotype and phenotype are cleaned and filtered using the quality
 control (QC) filters.
 In the second stage, the new filtered genotype/phenotype are formated for
 each GWAS tool which are executed in parallel by MultiGWAS.
 In the last stage, MultiGWAS scans the output files generated from each
 tool, summarizes their results, and report them through score tables, Venn
 diagrams, SNP profiles, and Manhattan plots.
 The configuration file includes: the genotype/phenotype filenames, genome-wide
 significance threshold, multiple testing correction method, GWAS model,
 number of associations to be reported, and TRUE or FALSE whether to use
 QC filters or not.
 The QC filters are: minor allele frequency, individual missing rate, SNP
 missing rate, Hardy-Weinberg threshold.

Marker plots generated by the MultiGWAS tool for the SolCAP potato panel.
 Case 1: Naive GWAS analysis, the four tools found the same set of five
 markers (center area, red marker names).
 Case 2, Full GWAS analysis, the two diploid tools found one common marker
 (upper-central area, red marker name), but the other two polyploid tools
 found a different common marker (lower-central area, yellow marker name).
 In both cases, other marker were found either by two tools or by one tool.

Motivation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The multiple available software packages provide the potential to enhance
 data analyses, but also create challenges for users.
 Most packages only use a command-line interface (CLI), which has a very
 steep learning curve for non-programmers.
 Furthermore, users must spend great effort when shifting from one package
 to another due to incon- sistent format requirements for input data.
 Users must take the time to reformat their data accordingly.
 As a result, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI)-based software
 package that can access multiple CLI packages, use any type of the input
 file format, and perform both GWAS and genomic prediction or selection
 is critically needed.

Different GWAS programs often produce dissimilar association results.
 Newer proposed approaches usually claim to have increased statistical power
 over previous of GWAS programs, evaluations methods.
 However, there are few independent especially in a plant and plant genomics
 context.
 It is important to understand the behaviour of these popular GWAS programs,
 and their sensitivity to input data quantity and to phenotypes where varying
 numbers of biological replicates are observed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
\size scriptsize
Background
\series default
: Non-coding RNAs gain more attention as their diverse roles in many cellular
 processes are discovered.
 At the same time, the need for efficient computational prediction of ncRNAs
 increases with the pace of sequencing technology.
 Existing tools are based on various approaches and techniques, but none
 of them provides a reliable ncRNA detector yet.
 Consequently, a natural approach is to combine existing tools.
 Due to a lack of standard input and output formats combination and comparison
 of existing tools is difficult.
 Also, for genomic scans they often need to be incorporated in detection
 workflows using custom scripts, which decreases transparency and reproducibilit
y.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
\size scriptsize
Results
\series default
: We developed a Java-based framework to integrate existing tools and methods
 for ncRNA detection.
 This framework enables users to construct transparent detection workflows
 and to combine and compare different methods efficiently.
 We demonstrate the effectiveness of combining detection methods in case
 studies with the small genomes of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes
 and Streptococcus pyogenes.
 With the combined method, we gained 10% to 20% precision for sensitivities
 from 30% to 80%.
 Further, we investigated Streptococcus pyogenes for novel ncRNAs.
 Using multiple methods–integrated by our framework–we determined four highly
 probable candidates.
 We verified all four candidates experimentally using RT-PCR.

Conclusions
\series default
: We have created an extensible framework for practical, transparent and
 reproducible combination and comparison of ncRNA detection methods.
 We have proven the effectiveness of this approach in tests and by guiding
 experiments to find new ncRNAs.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to validate GWAS results from a study is to replicate the analysis
 using a different tool, but using different GWAS software in plants to
 perform GWAS analyzes to the same genomic data often produce different
 results.
 Although the underlying model implemented in this kind of software could
 be different, each software has its own assumptions which could have a
 strong influence on the results which produces different associations and
 confuses the researchers from the true associations.
 Furthermore, many important crops are polyploids and new genomic data of
 polyploid plants are available much more frequently, but most of the GWAS
 software to analyze them have been developed for diploid organisms.
 Currently, two software tailored for polyploid organisms are the R package
 GWASpoly

However, each tool has its own way of doing things: different user interfaces
 (GUI or command line based), different input formats (phenotype and genotype
 formats), different models and algorithm assumptions, and different outputs.
 Consequently, in light of all these considerations, researchers must spend
 great effort when they try to replicate GWAS results by using different
 tools.
 With this in mind, we developed the MultiGWAS tool that with a single input
 it performs GWAS analyses by using four different GWAS software in such
 a way to help researchers in the selection of true associations across
 GWAS.
 The tool scans the different results files, calculates new scores and threshold
s from resulting markers, select best ranked and significative makers, and
 create summary tables and plots that show in an intuitive manner the common
 and different markers found by the four tools.

Goal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the GWAS provide
 preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis
 by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the
 chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides
 a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data
 are unavailable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The objective of this study was to develop a software package with the following
 functions: (1) performs both GWAS and genomic predic-tion, including GWAS-assis
ted genomic prediction; (2) offers a friendly GUI to reduce user learning
 time and (3) requires only one input data format to conduct any analysis
 with any incorporated method.

Intro:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Recent advances in genomics technologies have led to an explosion in available
 data.
 It is now possible to phenotype and genotype populations of hundreds, or
 even thousands, of plants.
 This data can then be used to run genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
 GWAS can associate differences in allele frequencies with differences in
 measured phenotypes.
 This has led to advances in understanding the genetic basis of many plant
 traits, from flowering time in soybean (Zhang et al., 2015) to fruit phenotypes
 in peach (Cao et al., 2016) and disease resistance in canola (Raman et al.,
 2016).
 (Roby2019)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- Current advances in genomics and bioinformatics provide opportunities
 for accelerating crop improvement.
 The rise of third generation sequencing technologies is helping overcome
 challenges in plant genome assembly caused by polyploidy and frequent repetitiv
e elements (Armin2018).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- As a result, high-quality crop reference genomes are increasingly available,
 benefitting downstream analyses such as variant calling and association
 mapping that identify breeding targets in the genome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- Currently, algorithms and softwares for genetic analysis of diploid organisms
 with bi-allelic markers are well-established, while those for polyploids
 are limited.
 (Shen2016)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- Despite the importance of polyploidy and the increasing availability of
 new genomic data, there remain important gaps in our knowledge of polyploid
 population genetics.
 (Dufresne2014)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- So far, there have been two software tools released for polyploid GWAS,
 namely the R package GWASpoly (Rosyara et al., 2016) and the previously
 mentioned SHEsisPlus (Shen et al., 2016).
 Of these, only GWASpoly looks critically at the form of the kinship matrix
 K.

Description:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The GWAS Pipeline was built in Python 2.6 and facilitates running GWAS.
 Given PLINK-formatted genotype and phenotype files, the pipeline will match
 them, apply filters, make kinship matrix and covariate files.
 Then the pipeline will run GWAS using linear mixed model(by EMMAX), and
 build Manhattan and QQ plots for each trait.
 In addition, the pipeline will also output a summary file showing only
 the most significant SNPs with allele effect calculated.

Methods and Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS was implemented in R.
 Genomic data files and parameters are specified in a configuration file
 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Adjust"

\end_inset

) which is passed as unique argument to MultiGWAS through the command-line
 interface using a terminal in Linux or Mac systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A flowchart of the main central steps involved in the three stages of the
 MultiGWAS tool is outlined in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Flowchar"

\end_inset

.
 The first stage preprocesses the inputs; the second stage performs GWAS
 on each tool; and the third stage postprocesses the outputs to summarize
 the results.
 These stages are detailed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adjustment stage
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MultiGWAS takes as input a configuration file where the user specifies the
 genomic data along with the parameters that will be used by the four tools
 to perform their particular GWAS analysis (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Flowchar"

\end_inset

).
 It starts by cleaning and filtering the genomic data.
 The first to get the common individuals to work with, and the second, to
 exclude from the analysis individuals and SNPs that are likely to be of
 poor-quality.

\begin_layout Standard
The allowed format for the marker data is the 
\begin_inset Quotes sld

 (e.g.

diploidize

 for Plink and Tassel (e.g.

 MultiGWAS does this by coding each marker in one of two possible ways:
 all possible homozygous genotypes are coded with two nucleotides (AAAA→AA,
 CCCC→CC, GGGG→GG, TTTT→TT); and all possible heterozygous genotypes are
 coded with the combination of their reference and alternate alleles calculated
 from the tetraploid marker (e.g.
 AAAT→AT, ...
 ,CCCG→CG).
 After that, the new filtered genotype and phenotype are transformed to
 the specific formats required for each tool.

El control de calidad de los datos se lleva a cabo a través de filtros que
 se aplican tanto al genotipo y al fenotipo y que buscan eliminar individuos
 y marcadores que no cumplan ciertos criterios y que pueden sesgar el análisis.
 Algunos filtros se aplican por defecto, como la eliminación de duplicados
 (tanto de individuos como de marcadores) y la eliminación de individuos
 sin información genotípica.
 Otros filtros se pueden seleccionar o ajustar sus valores a través del
 archivo de configuración, entre estos: frecuencia del alelo menor, porcentaje

 One of these parameters is the type of statistical GWAS model to be conducted,

.
 The first with control for population structure and individual relatedness;
 and the second without any of these controls.
 Controlling of population structure is based on the principal components
 (PCs) where each tool calculates the PCs and uses the top ten as covariates
 in their GWAS analysis.
 Controlling of individual relatedness is based on kinship matrices, where
 Tassel and GWASpoly make their own calculations, but Plink and SHEsis calculate
 them externally by the king software

When the filtered genotype and phenotype are ready for the four tools, each
 tool is executed in parallel by MultiGWAS using a parameterized script
 for each tool.
 Each script is called using as arguments the filtered genotype and phenotype
 along with the set of specified values for the arguments described in section

MultiGWAS integra cuatro herramientas de GWAS que deben estar previamente
 instaladas.
 Esto se puede llevar ya sea de forma automática, a través de la ejecución
 de un script propio de configuración que acompaña a MultiGWAS; o de forma
 manual, seguiendo las instrucciones de instalación propias de cada herramienta:

.
 In the first case (upper plot on the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cases"

\end_inset

), it shows that the four tools found a large set of common markers as the
 GWAS type used was Naive, without any controls for population structure
 or individual relatedness.
 However, two markers: the c1_8019 and the c2_25471 are reported by Rosayra
 et al., the first as the most significative association, and second as the
 second best ranked association.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second case (lower plot on the figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cases"

\end_inset

), it shows that the set of common markers is reduced, as the GWAS type
 used was Full GWAS with controls for population structure (10 PCs) and
 individual relatedness (kinship matrix).
 Now, the two polyploid tools GWASpoly and SHEsis found the common marker
 c1_8019, as in the Naive GWAS.
 But, the two diploid tools found a different common marker, the c1_16001.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MultiGWAS tool allows users to perform a GWAS analysis for tetraploid
 organism using four GWAS software at the same time: GWASpoly, SHEsis, Plink
 and Tassel.
 The tool deals with all the matters of the GWAS process in the four software,
 and only needs as input a simple configuration file with genomic filenames,
 values for different quality control filters, and the type of analysis
 to be performed.
 Analysis include both Full GWAS with control for population structure and
 individual relatedness, and Naive GWAS without any control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The summary reports generated by the MultiGWAS tool provide the user with
 tables and plots that show the significative and best ranked markers found
 by each tool.
 And, the marker plots is a powerful visualization that describes graphically
 the markers found by each tool and the common marker found by more than
 one tool, which help users to decide in a more intuitively way the possible
 true or false associations.
