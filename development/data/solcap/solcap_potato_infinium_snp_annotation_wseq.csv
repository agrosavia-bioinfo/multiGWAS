DOMINO1 is located in the nucleus.  Arabidopsis embryos carrying the domino1 mutation grow slowly in comparison with wild type embryos and reach only the globular stage at desiccation. The primary defect of the mutation at the cellular level is the large size of the nucleolus that can be observed soon after fertilization in the nuclei of both the embryo and the endosperm.  DOMINO1 might have a role in ribosome biogenesis and in determining the rate of cell division.
